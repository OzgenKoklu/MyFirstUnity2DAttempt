# MyFirstUnity2DAttempt
My first Unity project using "2D core". I learned game development basics by developing this mini 2D side scroller platformer.

# Things I've learned developing this project:
-Unity UI / layouts / Using Package manager
-How unity works - hierarchy, game objects, and components (transform, renderer, collider, rigid body, audio source, animator, etc.)
-Execution order - awake, start, fixedUpdate, update, late update, etc
-Working with 2D assets - tilemaps / Sorting Layers 
-Basics of Animation / Animator
-Input Manager (old system)
-Prefabs
-UI / Canvas / TextMeshPro 
-Scene Manager
-Getting Builds

# Game mechanics & Other on-screen actions using C# Scripting
-Waking
-Jumping
-Collectables
-Health & Game Over
-Scene changing (with character collision or button press for start screen)

# Notes
This project was done for learning purposes.
It was my first ever game build, artistically it does not look appealing
I used CC0 assets. Learned about asset usage ethics, and gathered my assets from Unity Asset Store and Kenney. 
I know that the first scene has decreasing health but the second one does not, the script does not exist in the second scene

# 08.04.2022 - DISCLAIMER - Notes about repo -
This repo was uploaded using Git Bash, I had yet to learn about Version Control Package provided by Unity Technologies. 
I did copy the project folder as is without tweaking any settings.
I just learned about visible/not visible Meta files and asset serialization options that can have an impact
From now on, for my Unity projects I will use the version control package provided by unity, however, just for a little challenge, 
I will try to fix issues with this repo by using conventional methods when I have the time.
